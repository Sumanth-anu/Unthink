### **If you see "Processing Failed":**

1. **Check server is running:**
   - Look for a PowerShell window with Flask server output

2. **Try the test again:**
   ```powershell
   cd "c:\Users\Sumanth Naik\OneDrive\Desktop\Unthinkable\meeting-summarizer"
   .\backend\venv\Scripts\python.exe test_application.py
   ```

3. **Check server logs:**
   - Look at the PowerShell window running the server
   - You'll see errors there if something went wrong

---

## 🎯 SIMPLE STEPS TO SEE IT WORK:

1. **Find the file:** `test_meeting.mp3` on your Desktop in the Unthinkable folder
2. **Open browser:** http://localhost:5000 (already open!)
3. **Drag file** into the upload area (or click Browse)
4. **Click** "Process Meeting"
5. **Wait** 2-3 minutes (don't close browser!)
6. **Enjoy** the results with beautiful animations!

---

## 💡 TIP:

The first time you process audio, Whisper downloads a model file (~150MB).  
This adds about 2 minutes to the first run. Subsequent runs are faster!
