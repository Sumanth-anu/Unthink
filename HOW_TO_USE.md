## ⏱️ PROCESSING TIME:

- **30-second audio**: ~1-2 minutes
- **1-minute audio**: ~2-3 minutes
- **5-minute audio**: ~5-8 minutes

**First time**: Whisper downloads a model file (~150MB) - adds 2-3 minutes

---

## ❗ COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS:

### **"Processing Failed" Error:**

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Audio file has no speech** → Use file with actual talking
2. **File is corrupted** → Try a different audio file
3. **File format not supported** → Use MP3, WAV, or M4A only
4. **Server stopped** → Check if PowerShell terminal is still running

### **How to Check Server Logs:**

Look at the PowerShell window where the server is running. When you upload and process, you should see:

```
127.0.0.1 - - [timestamp] "POST /api/upload HTTP/1.1" 200 -
Starting transcription for [meeting_id]...
Loading Whisper base model...
Transcribing audio file: [filepath]
Detected language: English
100%|████████████| [progress bar]
Generating summary for [meeting_id]...
127.0.0.1 - - [timestamp] "POST /api/process/[meeting_id] HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

If you see errors here, that's the issue!
