## 🔧 Technical Details

### Transcription

- **Engine**: OpenAI Whisper (local, no API key needed)
- **Model**: Base model (good balance of speed and accuracy)
- **Supported Languages**: Auto-detection for 90+ languages
- **Output**: Text transcript with timestamps

### Summarization

- **Engine**: Google Gemini AI (gemini-pro model)
- **Capabilities**:
  - Intelligent meeting summarization
  - Key decision extraction
  - Action item identification
  - Context-aware analysis

### LLM Prompt Strategy

The application uses carefully crafted prompts for optimal results:

```
You are an expert meeting analyst. Analyze the following meeting transcript and provide:

1. A concise summary (2-3 paragraphs) of the meeting
2. Key decisions made during the meeting
3. Action items with clear ownership if mentioned

Meeting Transcript:
{transcript}

Please format your response as follows:

SUMMARY:
[Provide a comprehensive summary here]

KEY DECISIONS:
- [Decision 1]
- [Decision 2]
...

ACTION ITEMS:
- [Action item 1]
- [Action item 2]
...
```

## 📊 Example Output

### Transcript
```
[00:00] Welcome everyone to today's product planning meeting.
[00:15] We need to discuss the Q1 roadmap and prioritize features.
[00:30] The main focus should be on improving user authentication.
...
```

### Summary
```
This meeting focused on Q1 product planning with emphasis on security 
improvements. The team discussed implementing two-factor authentication 
and improving the password reset flow. Budget allocation and timeline 
were also covered.
```

### Key Decisions
- Implement two-factor authentication by end of Q1
- Allocate $50K for security improvements
- Postpone mobile app redesign to Q2

### Action Items
- John to create technical spec for 2FA implementation (Due: Jan 20)
- Sarah to review authentication vendors (Due: Jan 25)
- Team to conduct security audit (Due: Feb 1)

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file with API keys
- Keep your Google API key secure
- Consider implementing authentication for production use
- Uploaded audio files are stored locally - implement cleanup policies
- Use HTTPS in production

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Error: "Google API key is required"**
- Make sure you've created a `.env` file with your `GOOGLE_API_KEY`

**Error: "No module named 'whisper'"**
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again
- Make sure you're in the virtual environment

**Transcription is slow**
- This is normal for the first run (model loading)
- Consider using a smaller Whisper model: `TranscriptionService(model_size="tiny")`
- For production, consider using GPU acceleration

**Audio file not supported**
- Check the file format is one of: WAV, MP3, M4A, FLAC, OGG, WEBM
- Ensure file is not corrupted
- File size must be under 100MB (configurable in config.py)

## 🚀 Deployment

### Local Development
```bash
python app.py
```

### Production (with Gunicorn)
```bash
pip install gunicorn
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
```
